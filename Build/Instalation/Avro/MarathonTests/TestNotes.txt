This directory holds Marathon GUI tests
You will need to install Marathon (1.??) to run them.


You will need to update Modules/commonBits.py

to reflect the operating system and where AvroEditor have been installed.

Tests are normally run in the Java Default Gui (i.e. successor to Metal)
rather than the System look and feel).
