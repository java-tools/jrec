<h1>JRecord</h1>
<p>The JRecord is for reading <ol compact>
  <li>Binary Files
  <li>Fixed field width files
  <li>CSV (Delimited) files
  <li>XML (via a StAX parser).
  <li>Supports non-standard file Structures (i.e. Mainframe VB  and Fixed Length).
</ol>
<p>JRecord also provides great flexibility in
<ul>
  <li>JRecord supports several non standard file structure (Fixed-Length Lines / Length-Based lines).
      It can also be extended to support other File Structures.
  <li>JRecord currently supports Cobol and its own Xml Record Layouts. It could be extended to support
      be extended to support other Record-Layouts.
</ul>

<p>Important packages in JRecord:
<ul>
  <li><b>Details</b> - Holds File & line definition classes. Important Interfaces / classes
    <ul compact>
     <li><b>AbstractLine</b> - Interface that specifies what a line (read from a file) does. 
     Use the <b>getFieldValue</b> method to get a reference to a field.
     There are 2 implementations of AbstractLine - <b>Line</b> and <b>XmlLine</b>.
     <li><b>LayoutDetail</b> - Class that describes a file (and its lines) Structure - i.e. the various records
            and where the fields start / end.
<pre>
     LayoutDetail  - Describes a file
       |
       +----- RecordDetail (1 or More) - Describes one record in the file
                |
                +------  FieldDetail (1 or More)  - Describes one field in the file 
</pre>     
      <li><b>AbstractFieldValue</b> - Interface to get/set a fields value - it is a reference to one field in a line.
    </ul>
  <li><b>IO</b> - Record Oriented IO routines. Important classes
    <ul compact>
      <li><b>AbstractLineReader</b> Abstract Class for reading AbstractLine's from a file. 
          All Reader's extend this class.
      <li><b>AbstractLineReader</b> Abstract Class for writing AbstractLine's to a file. 
          All Writer's extend this class.
      <li><b>CobolIOProvider</b> - Will create / provide a class's to read / write a Cobol file.
      <li><b>LineIOProvider</b> provide classes to read write files of a specified structure.
    </ul>
  <li><b>External</b> - Classes to read, write and convert File Definitions (Copybooks or Record Layouts).
    <ul compact>
      <li><b>ExternalRecord</b> Record Layout interchange format. It can be read/written from external
      files and converted to the internal format LayoutDetail.
      <li><b>ToRecordLayout</b> Convert a ExternalRecord class to an LayoutDetail class.
      <li><b>ToExternalRecord</b> Convert a LayoutDetail class to an ExternalRecord class.
      <li><b>RecordEditorXmlLoader</b> Loads a RecordEditor-Xml Layout as ExternalRecord
      <li><b>RecordEditorXmlWrite</b> Writes ExternalRecord to a file in the RecordEditor-Xml format
      <li><b>CopybookLoaderFactory</b> The  method getLayoutRecordEditXml which will load a RecordEditor-Xml file as
             a RecordLayout.    
    </ul>
  <li><b>Type</b> - Classes to convert a field from the External Representation
      to the Internal format.
  <li><b>ByteIO</b>  - Low level IO routines, most user should not need to look at this package
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>Following is an example of reading & writing a file using a RecordEditor-XML record-layout
<pre>
           LayoutDetail layout = CopybookLoaderFactory.getInstance().getLayoutRecordEditXml(copybookName, <font color="brown"><b>null</b></font>);
	            
           <font color="brown"><b>int</b></font> fileStructure = layout.getFileStructure();
	            
           AbstractLineReader reader  = LineIOProvider.getInstance().getLineReader(fileStructure);
           AbstractLineWriter writer  = LineIOProvider.getInstance().getLineWriter(fileStructure);
	            
           reader.open(salesFile, layout);
           writer.open(salesFileOut);

           <font color="brown"><b>while</b></font> ((saleRecord = reader.read()) != <font color="brown"><b>null</b></font>) {
               AbstractFieldValue salePrice = saleRecord.getFieldValue("<font color="blue"><b>SALE-PRICE</b></font>");
               
               salePrice.set(salePrice.asDouble() / GST_CONVERSION);
               writer.write(saleRecord);
           }

           reader.close();
           writer.close();
</pre>

<p><b>RecordEditor Interface</b>
<p>The following classes are used by the <b>RecordEditor</b> as interfaces to JRecord. You can extend the
RecordEditor by changing the appropriate interface class.
<ul>
  <li><b>CopybookWriterManager</b> - tells the RecordEditor what File base RecordLayouts can be loaded.
  <li><b>CopybookLoaderFactory</b> - tells the RecordEditor what File base RecordLayouts can be written.
  <li><b>LineIOProvider</b> - tells the RecordEditor what file structures are supported. 
  <li><b>TypeManager</b> - tells the RecordEditor what Types are supported. Note: the RecordEditor extends this class
  <li><b>ConversionManager</b> - tells the RecordEditor what Cobol numeric versions are available - ie how
  to translate Cobol numbers to RecordEditot / JRecord types.
