<h1>Marathon</h1>
<p>Marathon is a Swing Testing Tool that I use to Test the RecordEditor. 
I have included the Test for MSAccess, but these Tests can be adjusted to run with any
version (by changing the Sample File Directory).</p>
<p>Also these scripts where recorded with Swing Default Look and Feel (Metal). 
Some of the tests will need to editted to work with other Look and Feels.</p>
<p>If you record any scripts, you will find</p>
<ol>
 <li>Its best to keep scripts simple, several small scripts are better than one large one</li>
 <li>Not all parts of the RecordEditor work with Marathon (notibably any left mouse button click
 such as the Layout Wizard</li>
 <li>You will need edit some scripts</li>
 <li>If any one records some test scripts, please send them to me</li>
</ol>
