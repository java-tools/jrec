<h1>ProtoBuf Editor</h1>
<p>This program is for editing Binary Files in 
Googles Protocol Buffers format (2.20 and hopefully latter).
It is built on top of the RecordEditor Project 
(<a href="http://record-editor.sourceforge.net">RecordEditor</a>).

<p>The editor requires Protocol buffers 2.20 (or later ???)
to be installed. The Protocol Buffer programs need to be 
on the Program Path
