<h1>JavaDoc for Macro's (Scripts)</h1>
<p>This JavaDoc html holds the main classes / interfaces you will use 
when writing Scripts for the <b>RecordEditor</b> / <b>ReCsvEditor</b></p>
<p>Major classes include:
<ul>
 <li><a href="net/sf/RecordEditor/re/script/ScriptData.html" title="class in net.sf.RecordEditor.re.script">ScriptData</a>
     This is the main interface between your script and the <b>RecordEditor</b>. It holds
     methods to get at the Data, Create screens, run saved tasks etc.<p/>
 <li><a href="net/sf/RecordEditor/re/file/FileView.html" title="class in net.sf.RecordEditor.re.file">FileView</a>
    is the <b>RecordEditor's</b> internal description of a File and File-Views (created by filters etc).</li>
 <li><a href="net/sf/JRecord/Details/AbstractLine.html" title="interface in net.sf.JRecord.Details">AbstractLine</a>
    is the <b>RecordEditor's</b> internal description of a single Line or Record in the File. You can use the getFieldValue(..)
    to get individual field values. All current
    Line implementations also extend <a href="net/sf/JRecord/Details/BaseLine.html" title="class in net.sf.JRecord.Details">BaseLine</a>&lt;Layout extends <a href="net/sf/JRecord/Details/AbstractLayoutDetails.html" title="interface in net.sf.JRecord.Details">AbstractLayoutDetails</a>&gt;
    so you can use the getFieldIterator(...) methods.</li>
 <li>The <a href="net/sf/JRecord/Common/AbstractFieldValue.html" title="interface in net.sf.JRecord.Common">AbstractFieldValue</a>
    should be your main interface to indivaiual field values.<p/></li>
 <li></li><a href="net/sf/JRecord/Details/AbstractLayoutDetails.html" title="interface in net.sf.JRecord.Details">AbstractLayoutDetails</a>
    is the <b>file description</b> (or schema or Copybook in Cobol). The logical Relationship between
    the <b>file description</b> (or schema) classes is:

         |
         +----- <a href="net/sf/JRecord/Details/AbstractRecordDetail.html" title="interface in net.sf.JRecord.Details">AbstractRecordDetail</a> (1 or More) - Describes one record in the file   
                     |
                     +------  <a href="net/sf/JRecord/Common/IFieldDetail.html" title="interface in net.sf.JRecord.Common">IFieldDetail</a> (1 or More)  - Describes one field in the file
